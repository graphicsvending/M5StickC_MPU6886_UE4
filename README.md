# M5StickC_MPU6886_UE4

Hardware: M5StickC
Software: Arduino IDE, Unreal Engine 4.25, Lonet UE4 Plugin

Sending UDP packet...(roll, pitch, yaw data) from M5StickC MPU6886 to Unreal Engine 4(LiveLink) for CG virtual tracking... 
The code is sending Roll,Pitch, Yaw (Quaternion based and filtered by Madgwick)... but Yaw is drifting over the time (absence of magnetometer)

please feel free to input your code here...to enhance the functionality of this project...Thanks!
