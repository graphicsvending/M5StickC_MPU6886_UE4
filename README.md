# M5StickC_MPU6886_UE4

Hardware: M5StickC, wifi
Software: Arduino IDE, Unreal Engine 4.25

Sending UDP packet...(roll, pitch, yaw data) from M5StickC MPU6886 to Unreal Engine 4(LiveLink) for CG virtual tracking... 
my Arduino code is sending range +/- 90 degree of Roll & Pitch... but Yaw is drifting(MPU6886 lack of magnetometer)

I am still fine-tuning the code for getting full range +/-360 degree and less jitter output... 
seeking for help for better quality on MPU6886 data output... please feel free to input your code on this project...Thanks
